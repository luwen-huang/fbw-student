          <p>To access your Fly-by-Wire assignments, open up a web browser
            (Chrome, Safari, or FireFox is fine), and go to fbw-student.mit.edu.</p>
          <p>Click on the Arapahoe "MyACC" button, and enter your MyACC credentials.</p>
          <p>Once you log in, you'll be redirected to your Fly-by-Wire dashboard.</p>
          <p>I see that I have a mission due on Thursday, February 2,
            so if I click on "See Missions", I'll see all the missions that are waiting
            for me.</p>
          <p>Since my Unit 1 exam is coming up, I have a Fly-by-Wire
            mission waiting for me to complete, so I'm going to click on
            Unit 1 Review - Phase I.</p>
          <p>And this is what I will see.</p>
          <p>A mission consists of goals.</p>
          <p>You'll see the goals along the top of your screen.</p>
          <p>A goal is a learning objective from the unit.</p>
          <p>When you click on a goal, you will see some number of target questions.</p>
          <p>These icons below the goals are targets.</p>
          <p>If you click on one of them, you'll be given a practice problem that
            aligns with the goal above.</p>
          <p>Do your best to answer the target questions.</p>
          <p>Write down all your work as you attempt the problems, as this is what is expected
            on your exams.</p>
          <p>So for this problem, I'm going to select answer choice a, hit submit,
            and I see that I got a green checkmark and that the target
            is shown as being achieved.</p>
          <p>Alright, so let's move on to the next target question, and I'm going
            to select choice d.</p>
          <p>Click submit.</p>
          <p>This time I see that I got the question wrong.</p>
          <p>Fly-by-Wire also tells me that I might need to
            review a more fundamental objective and gives me an easier question
            that addresses this learning objective.</p>
          <p>The idea is that if I get this easier question right, it might help me answer the next
            target question correctly.</p>
          <p>Fly-by-Wire also shows me a solution to the original target question,
            so you can review that solution and compare it to your own and see
            where you might have made a misstep.</p>
          <p>So I'm going to take a look at the waypoint question.</p>
          <p>Hit submit, and see that I got it right, and it says "good job, you've reached the
            end of the route. Please try another target question."</p>
          <p>So if I go back up to the top, I see that Fly-by-Wire has recorded
            this target as "tried", and now I'm going to go on to the third
            target question.</p>
          <p>So you'll do this for each of the goals in your mission, and your
            personal goal is to get as many targets right as possible.</p>
          <p>When you've submitted your Phase 1 mission, you'll receive a personalized
            Phase 2 mission with more practice problems like the ones that you
            missed on your first mission.</p>
          <p>Fly-by-Wire saves your work automatically,
            so if you need to leave your mission and come back to it later, just be
            sure to log out and also log out of the D2L portal.</p>
